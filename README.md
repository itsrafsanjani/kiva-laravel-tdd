[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/sethsandaru/kiva-laravel-tdd/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=2PQOG1RYGQ)](https://codecov.io/gh/sethsandaru/kiva-laravel-tdd)

Let me introduce you to KivaNote, a simple real-world application using Laravel to show you
how the TDD & Unit Testing works (with PHP & Laravel).

TDD or Unit Testing, it's absolutely good practice and give the developers more confident & trust about their works, their project. Especially importance projects like:
Banking, Healthcare, E-commerce,...

I know out there, many people wants to learn how to write unit testing in proper/real-life ways. And the online articles are just:

- You need to write test
- Write a func `a + b = c` then `assertEquals(2, plus(1,1))`
    - BS, I know right??
- You need to test this, test that,...
- blah blah blah,...

Those articles won't help. In fact, you won't probably learn anything from that, especially for newbie. You always need to learn from
a real-world project.

So, this little project of mine is going to help you know how to write tests, especially using PHP & Laravel.

## Application Introduction
An API Application for a simple note application, also have Imgur as an external service (to store images).

## What do we have?
- PHP8
  - Super recommended, fast and added a lot of cool syntax.
- Laravel 8
- PHPUnit (of course)
- Coverage

## CI with GitHub Actions?
Yes. That's where the fun begin.

## Test definitions
- Unit Test
  - Where we're going to test just only a method of a Class
- Feature Test
  - HTTP Test to test the endpoints
- Quick Test
  - Same as Unit, but this test won't involve database, all we need to do is mocking then testing
- Integration Test
  - Test multiple endpoints of a flow to see if they are working correctly

### Coverage Info
So it depends which kind of projects are you working on to set a coverage goal.

In my opinion, **70%++** would be cool and give me a lot of confident. 

When you're writing unit tests, you should coverage all the cases that might happen and that would be totally enough.

Don't do trick or cheat to get high coverage though.

### Where should you start?
- Check out the routes and the Controllers
- Check out the `tests` folder
  - Quick first, then Unit and then Feature

## Contribute?
Sure, just fork it and add your PR, remember to:

- Write tests
- Follow PSR conventions
