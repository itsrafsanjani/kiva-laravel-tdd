# XXD - a Laravel TDD Sample Project

Let me introduce you to XXX, a simple real-world application using Laravel to show you
how the TDD & Unit Testing works.

TDD or Unit Testing, it's absolutely good practice and give the developers more confident & trust about their works, their project. Especially importance projects like:
Banking, Healthcare, E-commerce,...

I know out there, many people wants to learn how to write unit testing in proper/real-life ways. And the online articles are just:

- You need to write test
- Write a func `a + b = c` then `assertEquals(2, plus(1,1))`
    - BS, I know right??
- You need to test this, test that,...

Those articles won't help and you won't probably learn anything from that, especially for newbie.

So, this little project of mine is going to help you know how to write tests, especially using PHP & Laravel.

## Application Introduction
An API Application for a simple note application, also have Imgur as an external service (to store images).

## What do we have?
- PHP8
  - Super recommended, fast and added a lot of cool syntax.
- Laravel 8
- PHPUnit (of course)
- Coverage

## CI with GitHub Actions?
Yes. That's where the fun begin.

## Test definitions
- Unit Test
  - Where we're going to test just only a method of a Class
- Feature Test
  - HTTP Test to test the endpoints
- Quick Test
  - Same as Unit, but this test won't involve database, all we need to do is mocking then testing
- Integration Test
  - Test multiple endpoints of a flow to see if they are working correctly

## Contribute?
